## AddingBitcoin

Add a Bitcoin Cash (BCH) payment option to your business because it helps you with:

 1. **New business** - Nerds seek out and prefer businesses that accept Bitcoin Cash
 2. **No chargebacks** - Receive online easily and safely with no fraud risk
 3. **Cash-in-hand** - Instant, cleared payment. No waiting for funds from card processors
 4. **Sound money** - Fixed supply, non-government money - it can't be inflated by the ECB

Do you accept Bitcoin Cash yet?  Plenty of other merchants <a href="https://acceptbitcoin.cash" target="_blank">already do</a>.

## Tax, Accounting and Practical Steps

1. Add a 'Bitcoin Cash' payment type to your accounting / point-of-sale system
	* This is a new button complementing existing such as 'Card' or 'Cash'
	* It ensures year-end tax assessment and accounting are correct
2. Set up a BCH wallet on your phone
	* We recommend <a href="https://wallet.bitcoin.com/" target="_blank">Bitcoin.com</a> wallet
3. Set up an invoice footer, or clipboard sheet, with your BCH address
	* The footer is for invoices you send to customers
	* Add the footer to remittance advice slips sent to suppliers, too
	* The clipboard sheet is for '*bricks and mortar*' in-person sales

These are explained in more detail in the <a href="AddingBitcoin - QuickStart guide.pdf" target="_blank">Quick Start PDF</a>

### Questions or Concerns?

Here are some common reservations:


1. Is it worth the learning curve - even if it's free in Euros, is it worth the effort?
	* It does *not* make sense if your businesses currently has cashflow problems
	* For many small businesses however, it is worth it for gaining a niche of loyal customers
	* AddingBitcoin encourages merchant adoption by making it easier to understand and get started
2. Volatility - the price in Euros changes all the time
    * If you are forced to exchange BCH into Euros when the price is lower, then you would lose money at that time
	* However your exposure to risk is low, because it's still relatively niche. Only a small percentage of turnover would be in BCH
	* With fixed supply and *use as money*, the expectation is that the price in Euros will go up over the *long* term - say 3~5 years. Nothing is guaranteed however, up or down, as no-one can tell the future
	* By *not* selling into Euros you can also pay *your* suppliers in BCH - use as money. And position your business for a potential increase in price
	* You could also remove volatility risk entirely, but converting immediately into Euros at the time of payment. This is done by using a *payment processor*. It comes with a small cost overhead, similar to the cost of debit cards. Please contact us for recommendations



## About Us

AddingBitcoin is a non-profit, merchant-focused collection of resources for business owners to understand, accept and pay their suppliers in Bitcoin Cash.

It is run by volunteers who believe in the benefits of non-government sound money, that doesn't need a trusted third party.

There were many attempts at electronic money before <a href="https://www.bitcoincash.org/bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank">Satoshi Nakamoto's invention</a> - and many afterwards too. But as it stands today, Bitcoin Cash looks like the most likely to succeed. That's why we're here.

**Editorial Policy**

* Act in the *best interests of the merchant*. Be honest, especially if adding Bitcoin Cash may not help their business. Make recommendations based on best fit for the merchant - accept no inducements from platform providers to recommend their services
* Make *single* recommendations. One wallet, one point of sale solution, one web payment button, etc. Decisions slow down adoption. After a merchant has started, they will have a better idea of their needs and can evaluate additional options at that time

## Adding Bitcoin

Why add a Bitcoin Cash option? Because it helps you with:

 1. New business - BCH nerds seek out and prefer businesses that accept Bitcoin Cash.
 2. Sound money - non-government, fixed supply cash money that cannot be 'printed' by politicians.
 3. No chargebacks - Fraud protection is built-in, with no cost to you.
 4. Your eduction - get ahead of curve in crypto education and understanding.
 
Do you accept Bitcoin Cash yet?  Plenty of other merchants [already do](https://acceptbitcoin.cash).

### Potential Downsides?

One man's downside is another man's advantage, so it depends on your business situation. Here are some common reservations

1. Volatility. The price in Euros changes *all the time*. There is a risk your business could lose money, if you are forced to change BCH into Euros when the price is lower.
2. Is it worth it? Any business process change has an effort 'cost', even though it's free in Euros. Whether accepting Bitcoin Cash benefits your business enough to offset that will depend on your business type and market.

## Addressing Potential Downsides

1. Volatility
	* Your risk exposure is very low because few people use it today. So it means a very small percentage of your turnover would be in BCH.
	* By not selling into Euros, you can pay *your* suppliers in BCH - use as money - as well as position your business for a potential increase in price.
	* With fixed supply and *use as money*, the expectation is that the price in Euros will go up over the *long* term - say 3~5 years. Nothing is guaranteed however, up or down, as no-one can tell the future.
	* Alternatively, you can convert immediately into Euros at the time of receipt by using a *payment processor*. This completely removes volatility risk, but at a small cost overhead similar to the cost of debit cards.
	
2. Is it worth it?
	* For most small businesses, and many large ones, we believe that over the long term, it will very much be worth it.
	* It would not make sense if your businesses has cashflow problems.
	* Our goal is to reduce the effort 'cost' to you, making it worthwhile for a larger number of businesses.

## Practical Steps, Tax, Accounting


These are explained in the <a href="AddingBitcoin - QuickStart guide.pdf">Quick Start PDF</a> and summarised below:

1. Set up a BCH wallet on your phone.
	* We recommend <a href="https://wallet.bitcoin.com/">Bitcoin.com</a> wallet
2. Print a "clipboard sheet" and update invoice footer with your BCH address
	* The clipboard sheet is for 'bricks and mortar' in-person sales
	* The footer is for invoicing suppliers 
3. Add a Bitcoin Cash button or option to your PoS/accounting system
	* This ensures correct accounting and year-end tax assessment


## About Us

AddingBitcoin is a non-profit, merchant-focused collection of resources for business owners to understand, accept and pay their suppliers in Bitcoin Cash.

It is run by volunteers who believe in the benefits of non-government sound money, that doesn't rely on a trusted third party.

There were many attempts at electronic money before [Satoshi Nakamoto's invention](https://www.bitcoincash.org/bitcoin.pdf) - and many afterwards too. But as it stands today, Bitcoin Cash looks like the most likely to succeed. That's why we're here.

**Editorial Policy**

* Act in the *best interests of the merchant*. Be honest, especially if adding Bitcoin Cash may not help their business. Make recommendations based on best fit for the merchant - accept no inducements from platform providers to recommend their services.
* Make *single* recommendations. One wallet, one point of sale solution, one web payment button, etc. Decisions slow down adoption. After a merchant has started, they will have a better idea of their needs and BCH turnover. And therefore in a good position to evaluate other options at that time.

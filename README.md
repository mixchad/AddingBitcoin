## Adding Bitcoin Cash payment option - is it right for you?

If the above applies to you then you should add Bitcoin Cash to your business. It's easy - generate an address (similar to an IBAN) and give it to your customers online and in person. Let your suppliers know that you can pay in Bitcoin Cash too.

### Questions or Concerns?

Here are some common reservations:

1. Is it worth the learning curve - even though it's free, is it worth the effort?
	* It may not make sense if your businesses currently has cashflow problems (or convert immediately to Euros - see volatility below)
	* For many most businesses, it is worth it for gaining (or keeping) a niche of loyal customers
1. Volatility - the price in Euros changes all the time
	* You can remove volatility risk entirely, by converting immediately into Euros at the time of payment. This is done by using a *payment processor*. Or we can do it at cost for 3 months to help you get started
	* Note that you can also pay *your* suppliers in BCH - using it as money and stimulating the local Berlin economy. And position your business for potential increases in price
	* Your financial risk exposure is low because only a small percentage of your turnover would be in BCH
	* With fixed supply and *use as money*, the long term expectation of supply and demand is that the price in Euros will go up. This is over the *long* term - say 3~5 years - and of course not guaranteed


## About Us

AddingBitcoin is a non-profit, merchant-focused collection of resources for business owners to understand, accept and pay their suppliers in Bitcoin Cash.

It is run by volunteers who believe in the benefits of non-government hard money. Hard money doesn't need a trusted third party like a PayPal, Facebook, or central bank.

There were many attempts at electronic money before <a href="https://www.bitcoincash.org/bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank">Satoshi Nakamoto's invention</a> - and many afterwards too. But as it stands today, Bitcoin Cash looks like the most likely to succeed.


## How? Tax, Accounting and Practical Steps

1. Set up a BCH wallet on your phone
	* We recommend <a href="https://wallet.bitcoin.com/" target="_blank">Bitcoin.com</a> wallet
	* Write your twelve-word seed by hand. On a pad and keep that safe, eg with your passport
	* Click receive on the app and note your BCH address, which works similarly to an IBAN
1. Add a 'Bitcoin Cash' button on your point-of-sale system
	* Minimal staff training, they enter Euro amount and the new BCH button instead of Card or Cash
	* Add Bitcoin Cash payment type on your back-end accounting system
	* It is [legal, private money in Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_bitcoin_by_country_or_territory#Germany "On 19 August 2013, the German Finance Ministry announced that bitcoin is now essentially a unit of account and can be used for the purpose of tax and trading in the country. It is not classified as a foreign currency or e–money but stands as private money, according to the ministry."), you don't need permission from the state or your accountant
1. Advertise your BCH address to customers and suppliers
    * Add it to your website front page, and at checkout
	* Add it to your invoices, near your IBAN bank details
	* Add it to remittance advice slips to suppliers 
	* For in-person, '*bricks and mortar*' sales then either:
	  * Print a branded '[clipboard sheet]({{ site.url }}/assets/AddingBitcoin - QuickStart guide.pdf "Quick Start Guide")' to hand to customers, freeing up your staff for other tasks
	  * Take payments on a tablet or similar device using the [Cash Register App](https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-cash-register/).

###  Why we believe in Bitcoin Cash

**Money:** Bitcoin Cash is *money*. Rather than simply physical notes, think of money as a *veil over barter* - a medium of exchange that has value only because *we know we can exchange it for other goods and services*.

**Cash:** *Cash* is a type of money that can't be revoked. Once it's in your hand (or wallet app), it's yours. Electronic money via banks and payment processors aren't cash. Not because they're electronic though, but because the money is the bank's money - it isn't really yours. What you have instead is a promise from the bank that you can receive that money in the future. Bitcoin Cash *is cash* because once you receive it to a wallet that you control, no-one can revoke it or limit your spending. Just like notes. In contrast, banks' promises are not kept in many instances:

 1. [Chargebacks](https://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/8-merchant-tips-avoid-chargebacks-1455.php) take previously credited funds away from you
 2. Limit withdrawals to keep a [minimum balance](https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/Merchant-services-Archive/Paypal-s-reserve-is-thievery/td-p/54876/page/3#)
 3. Bank runs, complete or partial, such as the [€100/day limit in Cyprus](https://www.rt.com/business/cyprus-bailout-withdrawal-banks-756/), in 2013


**Hard Money:** Bitcoin Cash is hard money because it has a fixed supply; additional units can't be 'printed' by banks or government central banks. Historically, *Hard money* meant coins made out of precious metal commodities such as gold or silver; or currency whose value ties directly to a specific commodity. Fiat money, in contrast, isn't tied to any fixed supply, and so can be inflated at will.

Over the long term, inflating or 'printing money' means *everyone's* purchasing power is reduced - each unit of money buys you less goods. Think of the Weimar Republic, Mugabe's Zimbabwe, or present-day Venezuelan Bolivars. 

Those are extremes, but the principle applies to moderate inflation in the Eurozone today - as shown in the prices of one litre (1 Maß) of beer, below.

**Editorial Policy**

* Act in the *best interests of the merchant*. Be honest, especially if adding Bitcoin Cash may not help their business. Make recommendations based on best fit for the merchant - accept no inducements from platform providers to recommend their services
* Make *single* recommendations. One wallet, one point of sale solution, one web payment button, etc. Decisions slow down adoption. After a merchant has started, they will have a better idea of their needs and can evaluate additional options at that time
